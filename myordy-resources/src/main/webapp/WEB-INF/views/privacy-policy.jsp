<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2><a href='javascript:popupJrange();'>Jrange Pty Ltd</a></h2>

<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Jrange we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
    <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
    <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
    <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public and permanently deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jrange Pty Ltd ("Jrange") operates several websites including myordy.com.au.
It is Jrange's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Jrange collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Jrange's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Jrange's visitors use its website. From
time to time, Jrange may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report
on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Jrange also collects potentially
personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Jrange does not use such information to
identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it
uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to Jrange's websites choose to
interact with Jrange in ways that require Jrange to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
information that Jrange gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for
an account at myordy.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Jrange are asked
to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process
those transactions. In each case, Jrange collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
fulfil the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Jrange. Jrange does not disclose personally-identifying
information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>Jrange may collect statistics about the behaviour of
visitors to its websites. For instance, Jrange may monitor the most popular Web Addresses on myordy.com.au site. Jrange
may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Jrange does not disclose personally-identifying
information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Jrange discloses potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that (i)
need to know that information in order to process it on Jrange's behalf or to provide services available at Jrange's
websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using Jrange's websites, you consent to the transfer of
such information to them. Jrange will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above, Jrange
discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law,
or when Jrange believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
Jrange, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Jrange website and have supplied your
email address, Jrange may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
keep you up to date with what's going on with Jrange and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a
minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Jrange
takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. </span><span class="T5">Jrange
uses cookies to help Jrange identify and track visitors, their usage of Automattic website, and their website access
preferences. Jrange visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
refuse cookies before using Jrange's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Jrange's websites may not
function properly without the aid of cookies.</span></p>

<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising
partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognise your computer each time they send you an
online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad
networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Jrange and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Jrange
may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Jrange's sole discretion. Jrange encourages visitors to
frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact Jrange.</p>
